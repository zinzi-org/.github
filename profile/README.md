# Project Zinzi

Project Zinzi is a nonprofit open source initiative maintained by a community of software developers. 

Our goal is to provide a platform that will host other member based organizations with easy to use cryptographic proof of membership. Although proof of membership is just a small part of the puzzle. Project zinzi aims to seed decentralized platforms that will harness the benefits of this membership platform to ensure a successful ecosystem. 

Zinzi consists of three core elements.
Member Board - Ethereum Based Governance  Smart Contract
Member -  ERC721 Soulbound Membership Token
Project -  ERC721 Transferable Token

## Member Board

Before someone can claim to be a member of an organization, the organization must be defined. 

A member board is something that anyone can create, all you need is a name.

When a new user creates a member board he is calling the Member Board Factory smart contract which in turn deploys a new Member Board smart contract into the ethereum network.

A Member Board smart contract can have up to three board members.  The person who created the board initially will be marked as the first board member.

Board members will be voted on annually and are subject to flash impeachment proceedings. 

Each contract can accept new member applicants who must meet the interview criteria defined by the board members. 

Board members are required to create and maintain a group's interview process. Members who are being admitted are subject to peer review via internal ethics reviews and impeachment proceedings.
