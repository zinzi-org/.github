# Project Zinzi


The goal of Project Zinzi is to implement and maintain a series of Solidity smart contracts that will provide the structure for anyone to build a fully functioning organization that exists on chain. The contracts will include governance, member boards, members, proposals and projects for members to bid on that can be potentially monetized. We want to borrow all possible structures that can be observed in modern day corporations and nonprofit organizations and implement them into a defined smart contract protocol and make it open source and free for anyone to build organizations that have defined and maintained membership. 


### [Core Contracts](https://github.com/zinzi-org/core-contracts)

- Governor Board Factory
- Governor Board
- Members (ERC721 Soulbound Membership Token)
- Members Vote (ERC20 Token Implementing the ERC20Votes Interface)

## Governor Board & Factory

## Member NFT

Once an applicant is admitted to a board by a member after an interview process he will be minted a soulbound NFT. 

This NFT has a variety of benefits, for instance if the board of members you belong to is prestigious it could help you find work and other social benefits. Helping people find work is something the Zinzi foundation wants to focus on.

We will accomplish the goal of providing work to members. Project zinzi will maintain a variety of Project NFTs. These projects will be auctioned on open NFT markets where members can place bids on the projects. If a project requires a big undertaking and two board members agree a NFT can project, NFT can be bid on by an organization. Individual members can submit independent bids as well.

## Member Votes

## Project NFT

After a Project NFT is awarded to a member bidder the contract becomes unlocked. A Project NFT can have many types. 

- Crowd Loan Project Type
- One Time Funded Project Type
- Agile Project Type

When a bid is accepted and the proposal is accepted by the member the project type will unlock a series of functions  based on the needs of the individual or group that created the proposal and the individual or groups who accepted the proposal with a winning bid.
