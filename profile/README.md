# Project Zinzi

Project Zinzi is a nonprofit open source initiative maintained by a community of software developers. 

Our goal is to provide a platform that will host other member based organizations with easy to use cryptographic proof of membership. Although proof of membership is just a small part of the puzzle. Project zinzi aims to seed decentralized platforms that will harness the benefits of this membership platform to ensure a successful ecosystem. 

Zinzi consists of three core elements.
- Member Board (Ethereum Based Governance  Smart Contract)
- Member (ERC721 Soulbound Membership Token)
- Project (ERC721 Transferable Token)

## Member Board

Before someone can claim to be a member of an organization, the organization must be defined. 

A member board is something that anyone can create, all you need is a name.

When a new user creates a member board he is calling the Member Board Factory smart contract which in turn deploys a new Member Board smart contract into the ethereum network.

A Member Board smart contract can have up to three board members.  The person who created the board initially will be marked as the first board member.

Board members will be voted on annually and are subject to flash impeachment proceedings. 

Each contract can accept new member applicants who must meet the interview criteria defined by the board members. 

Board members are required to create and maintain a group's interview process. Members who are being admitted are subject to peer review via internal ethics reviews and impeachment proceedings. 


## Member NFT

Once an applicant is admitted to a board by a member after an interview process he will be minted a soulbound NFT. 

This NFT has a variety of benefits, for instance if the board of members you belong to is prestigious it could help you find work and other social benefits. Helping people find work is something the Zinzi foundation wants to focus on.

We will accomplish the goal of providing work to members. Project zinzi will maintain a variety of Project NFTs. These projects will be auctioned on open NFT markets where members can place bids on the projects. If a project requires a big undertaking and two board members agree a NFT can project, NFT can be bid on by an organization. Individual members can submit independent bids as well.

## Project NFT

After a Project NFT is awarded to a member bidder the contract becomes unlocked. A Project NFT can have many types. 

Crowd Loan Project Type
One Time Funded Project Type
Agile Project Type

When a bid is accepted and the proposal is accepted by the member the project type will unlock a series of functions  based on the needs of the individual or group that created the proposal and the individual or groups who accepted the proposal with a winning bid.
